# Apache Apollo - http://activemq.apache.org/apollo/
ActiveMQ's next generation of messaging.


## Description
ActiveMQ apollo is a faster, more reliable, easier to maintain messaging broker built from the foundations of the original ActiveMQ. It accomplishes this using a radically different threading and message dispatching architecture. Like ActiveMQ, apollo is a multi-Protocol broker and supports STOMP, AMQP, MQTT, Openwire, SSL, and WebSockets.
