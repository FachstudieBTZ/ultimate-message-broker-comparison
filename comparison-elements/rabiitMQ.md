# RabbitMQ - https://www.rabbitmq.com/
ActiveMQ's next generation of messaging.


## Description
ActiveMQ Apollo is a faster, more reliable, easier to maintain messaging broker built from the foundations of the original ActiveMQ. It accomplishes this using a radically different threading and message dispatching architecture. Like ActiveMQ, Apollo is a multi-Protocol broker and supports STOMP, AMQP, MQTT, Openwire, SSL, and WebSockets.
